# Hatche
Hatche is a Poke'mon styled pet manager for iOS targeted at reptiles. The user can add their creature and attributes such as weight, sex and lineage. As the pet grows you can add new weights and the progress can be viewed in a line graph. The pets "card" can be shared on facebook and an album can be used to store images.
